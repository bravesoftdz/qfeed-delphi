Back in 2000, there was a company called Quote.com that published a product called QFeed. Since I preferred Borland Delphi and they only had a C++ DLL or an OCX, I decided to write a Delphi binding.

QFeed has since been acquired by [Linn Software Partners](http://www.linnsoft.com/). You should [visit the QFeed home page](http://www.linnsoft.com/QFeed/) to see what they've done with it; I have no idea.

This is legacy code and almost certainly no longer works with the current QFeed product. It's here only because I hate to throw away what I consider good code, even if it is obsolete.
